   <p>Slay the spire is a kind of popular roguelike and yet not a whole lot of people make content or even stream it. Generally, when people make content, they need to be engaging to the person watching it. There is a large array of things that you can do in the game like making fun combos, general fun gameplay and even a mode where you can add custom game mode and play it (Theres even a daily climb where the settings are random, and it feels like a new game every day so why is there so little content being made of it.</p>
   <p>One reason could be that it involves a lot of strategy and so people don’t feel as engaged watching it as they want faster placed gameplay. </p>
   <p>Another is that the updates are very infrequent, and gameplay (at times) can feel repetitive despite everything you can do in the game so streamers don’t feel as though can cultivate an audience through this game and/or they themselves don’t want to play it.</p>
